# VulkanCapySnake
Classic snake game flavored with chiguiros written in Vulkan API.

### Backlog:
- Use textures or images of capybaras (obviously) in each Block
- Reset game when snake is out of map
- Research if snake movement and growth should be done inside vertex shader
- Add text to screen with score
- Implement error when head collision with body
